## Project: Pandas Homework - Heroes of PyMoli

## Description:
This project was created to demonstrate a number of data analysis concepts using a set of purchase data from a fictional game, Heroes of PyMoli. Data analysis was conducted using the pandas library for Python and the JupyterLab environment. Concepts covered include: importing/reading .csv files using pandas, storing data in variables, creating and modifying lists and dictionaries, slicing data, grouping, sorting, binning, using functions, methond chaining, creating customized viewable dataframes, formatting for presentation, debugging, etc.

## Observable Trends from Analysis:
Three readily observable trends from the analysis are that
- The game's primary purchasers of items are males between the ages of 15 and 24;
- Players in the 20-24 age demographic spend by far the most money on in-game purchases (than 2.5x that of the next highest spending age demographic of 15-19); and
- The three most popular items based on number of sales are in order: the "Final Critic," the "Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm," and the "Fiery Glass Crusader." Of note, the "Nirvana" item also has an equivalent number of sales as the "Fiery Glass Crusader," however the "Nirvana" is slightly more profitable as it has a higher average purchase price.

## **Important Usage Notes:**
The HeroesofPymoli Jupyter Notebook file contains both the relevant code and the final dataframe outputs. This file references the .csv data file in Resources using its relative path.
